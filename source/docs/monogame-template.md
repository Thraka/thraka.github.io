title: MonoGame Template
layout: docpage
---


If you're using a MonoGame template to create a new project, which auto-generated your `game1` code file, follow these steps. If you're using MonoGame from a brand new .NET project that was not generated by MonoGame, see the [NuGet Starter](NuGet-Starter-MonoGame.md) topic.

>**NOTE**
>SadConsole for MonoGame targets .NET 4.5. You may use a higher version if necessary.

>**TIP**  
Check out the [NuGet starter](NuGet-Starter-MonoGame.md) instructions if you don't have MonoGame installed. 

1. After creating a new project, open the *game1.cs* or *game1.vb* source code file
2. Right-click on the project and click Manage NuGet Packages.
5. Search for [SadConsole.Starter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadConsole.Starter/) and add it.

    >**TIP:**  
    >If you're using **Linux**, NuGet may not setup your project correctly. Look at the folder containing your project. Add any **.font** and **.png** as project references and set them to **Copy to output folder**.

6. Open up your `game1.cs` file.
7. Change the base class from the MonoGame Game class to `SadConsole.Game`

    ```csharp
    public class Game1 : SadConsole.Game
    ```

8. Change the constructor to initialize SadConsole. Provide the font and width/height of the game window in cells.

    ```csharp
    public Game1() : base("IBM.font", 80, 25, null)
    ```

#### Initialize
Before anything can be done with SadConsole, the main engine must be initialized. The initialization routine takes a GraphicsDevice reference object. 

At least one font file must be loaded into the engine as the default font. A font is a set of cells representing every character used by your game. The following example overrides the Initialize() method on a Game class:

```csharp
protected override void Initialize()
{
    // Generally you don't want to hide the mouse from the user
    IsMouseVisible = true;

    // Finish the initialization of SadConsole
    base.Initialize();

    // Create your console
    var firstConsole = new SadConsole.Console(60, 30);

    firstConsole.FillWithRandomGarbage();
    firstConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(2, 2, 20, 3), Color.Aqua, Color.Black, 0);
    firstConsole.Print(3, 3, "Hello World!");

    SadConsole.Global.CurrentScreen.Children.Add(firstConsole);
}
```

### Example game1.cs class

This class shows using the SadConsole Engine Component to initialize MonoGame

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace SadRogueSharp
{
    public class Game1 : SadConsole.Game
    {
        public Game1() : base("IBM.font", 80, 25, null)
        {
            
        }

        protected override void Initialize()
        {
            // Generally you don't want to hide the mouse from the user
            IsMouseVisible = true;

            // Finish the initialization of SadConsole
            base.Initialize();

            // Create your console
            var firstConsole = new SadConsole.Console(60, 30);

            firstConsole.FillWithRandomGarbage();
            firstConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(2, 2, 20, 3), Color.Aqua, Color.Black, 0);
            firstConsole.Print(3, 3, "Hello World!");

            SadConsole.Global.CurrentScreen.Children.Add(firstConsole);
        }
    }
}
```

Now that you have the project created and working, check out the [existing tutorials](index.md). These will walk you through the basics.
