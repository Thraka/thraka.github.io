Version 8 of SadConsole has been released and all of the prior documentation has been archived [here](archive-version7/).

SadConsole is pretty simple to get up and running. If you're working with the starter project included in the source code, you can tweak that to test out engine features. 

* [New project for .NET Core](getting-started-sadconsole-core-standard.md)
* [New project for .NET Framework](getting-started-with-sadconsole-framework.md)

If you are migrating an existing project from Version 7 to Version 8, read the [upgrade guide](upgrade-version-7-to-8.md).
