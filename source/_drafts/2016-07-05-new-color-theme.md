The color theme for the control system has always been sort of .. well .. bland. In creating the [SadConsole Editor](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsoleEditor/) program, I created a new theme. It's a bit brown and yellow based, it works for what I want it to do, but I wanted to look at making a brighter version. Here are some screenshots.

## Original

The basic color theme that comes with the SadConsole control system is just mostly black, white, and gray.

## SadConsole editor

The editor uses a brown and yellow styled color system.

## New colors

The new colors look like this for version 3.

Personally, I really like it. Maybe I need to tweak some of the shades a bit here or there, but I think it will look nice for the default version.
